Common infrastructure that is usable by diverse participants doesn't come for
free: it requires cooperation, patience, time, and care. When a community
decides to invest its resources into creating and maintaining a common good,
like F/OSS scientific software or interoperability standards, they can reap
significant rewards: both from an academic/research perspective, and from a
commercial market perspective.

How do we build communal goods that are 1) made in an open manner 2) not
heavy-handed top-down projects 3) attentive to actual needs of others and 4)
still useful?

As a follow-up to the debut at BOSC 2015 of a project that began at the BOSC
2014 Codefest, we are proud to present version 1.0 of the Common Workflow
Language and the community of practitioners, implementors, vendors, academics,
and businesses involved in its creation and maintenance. 

In this talk we present an update on our activities this last year and how we
(and the standards) changed along the way. The challenges outlined above will
be reviewed alongside what we have done, or plane to do, to address them.
